## Getting Started
To safely start off your new flutter application while basing it off this project:
- `git clone git@github.com:lexxyungcarter/flutter-starter-kit.git myapp`
- Then open the folder inside **Android Studio** (Sorry `vscode` guys).
- Using **Android Studio**, update the `namespace` of your project. 
- You're good to go
- Go under `lib > utils` folder and update your `constants` and `styles` file accordingly.
- You can even create an `env.dart` file inside there to store your *secret keys* such as *api keys* while testing. This file will not be saved in git for privacy concerns

### How to rename to your namespace (technically, to your appId)
Say, your new `appId` is meant to be `example.company.myapp`, here's how to go about it:
- Ensure **Android Studio** has finished indexing your project. **VERY IMPORTANT**
- Making sure you're in the **Project Viewer* mode, expand on the **starterkit_android** to its entirety
- As you can see, the current `nammespace` is set to `space.acelords.starterkit`
- Right-click on `space`, select `refactor`>`rename` and rename to your desired name, e.g. `example`
- Select **Do Refactor** on all files presented at the terminal.
- Repeat the same steps for the other parts of the `namespace`, i.e. `acelords` => `example` and `starterkit` => `myapp`
- Confirm the namespace changing in `AppManifest` and all `build,gradle` files.
- You're good to proceed building your app.

## Building in DEV and Deploying to PRODUCTION
When building your app, you may need to set some things to testing (such as **Google Ads**) to avoid any penalties. And when deploying, you may also need to revert a setting to production mode (such as **Google Ads** also to display real ads)

### Setting up for Local Development
- Go to `lib > utils > admob_constants.dart` file
- Set `static bool testing = true;`
- Go to `lib > utils > constants.dart` file
- Set `static bool testing = true;`

### Setting up for Production Development
- Go to `lib > utils > admob_constants.dart` file
- Set `static bool testing = false;`
- Go to `lib > utils > constants.dart` file
- Set `static bool testing = false;`

Also ensure you have provided your correct Google Ad Units in `admob_constants.dart` file. This way, you'll ensure your app displays correct ads in PlayStore.

> NB: To deploy Flutter app to store for the first time, you might need to read up on [How To](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android). These instructions assume you already know how to. 

### Google AdMob
To setup Google Ads, 
- Update this file accordingly: `lib > utils > admob_constants.dart`.
- Update the app's `build.gradle` (located under `android > app > build.gradle`) and go to line `68`. Update as instructed in the comments. 
- Update the projects' `build.gradle` (located under `android > build.gradle`) and go to line `12`. Update as instructed in the comments. 

Remember to update **Your_Admob_App_ID** in the respective platforms. 
##### For iOS
- Go to `ios > Runner > Info.plist` file
- Navigate to line `#45` and update **Your_Admob_App_ID** accordingly.

##### For Android
- Go to `android > app > src > main > AndroidManiifest.xml` file
- Navigate to line `#16` and update **Your_Admob_App_ID** accordingly.

### FaceBook Ads
The setup for facebook ads is similar. The same file `lib > utils > admob_constants.dart` can be used/modified or another new file created for easier ads management.


### Setting up FCM - Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Go to `lib > utils > constants.dart` file
- Search line #36 `static String publicTopicKey = testing ? "testing" : "public";`
- Set the topic you'd like to always post to once app is run
- Update **AndroidManifest.xml** file  `android > app > src > main > AndroidManifest.xml`. Go to line `20` and update accordingly.
- You can also update **Colors** file `android > app > src > main > res > values > colors.xml` to match your app's theme color.

For apps requiring many topics, you can register multiple topics as required.
> NB: Ensure you understand FCM from the developers console at Google. A medium article is under authoring to explain this further.

In case you need the **Firebase Functions** setup project, contact us and we'll gladly organize how. It is written in **Node**. **Firebase Functions** can automatically send notifications to your users when a CRUD operation happens in **Firebase CloudStore** e.g. a new order, a new blog post, a team won, or an invoice payment. Your imagination is the limit.

## Updating Launcher Icon
Design your app logo, preferably in **1024x1024** size (px). 
Once done, open [https://appicon.co/#app-icon](https://appicon.co/#app-icon) in your browser and generate a new set of icons.
- Place **appstore.png** to `assets > icon` and rename it to **icon.png**
- Copy the other folders to their respective locations. For instance, on android it is `android > app > src > main > res`.
> NB: You might need to manually remove **Icon** files from the folders. The website weirdly adds the unnecessary files, hindering a successful build
- Once done, run this command in terminal: `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`
